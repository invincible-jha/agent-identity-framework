Contribution guidelines for `agent-identity-framework` are coming soon.

In the meantime:

1. Fork the repository and create a feature branch from `main`.
2. Follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification.
3. Ensure all existing tests pass before opening a pull request.
4. Read [FIRE_LINE.md](./FIRE_LINE.md) before adding new types or methods — boundary violations will cause PR rejection.

For major changes, open an issue first to discuss the proposal.
